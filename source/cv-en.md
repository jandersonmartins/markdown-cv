Our engineering strategy focused on microservices and micro front-ends by context, based on domain-driven design.

> In the backend services, my primary focus was on services built with Kotlin and Spring Boot, with a legacy in Ruby using Hanami, as well as BFFs (Back-end for Front-end) in Node.js with GraphQL. These services ran on Kubernetes in AWS using Terraform as IaC, communicating via HTTP or Kafka, with Postgres as the main database choice. On the front end, most development was done in React + GraphQL, with only one legacy application in Ember.js.
